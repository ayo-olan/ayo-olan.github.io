I am an Acting Assistant Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Washington in Seattle. I received undergraduate and master’s degrees in Electrical Engineering at the University of Alberta in Canada and completed a Ph.D. in Biological and Biomedical Engineering at McGill University with my dissertation focused on [3D-printed microfluidic circuits for self-powered and self-regulated bioassays](http://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p237f). Afterwards, I worked as an industrial postdoctoral fellow with Sensoreal Inc – a startup that aimed to commercialize self-powered microchips for [rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections in infants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqPDxmFFDW8). My current research at the University of Washington is focused on developing rapid and user-friendly tests for [monitoring antiretroviral drug levels in patients to improve Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) treatment and prevention outcomes] (https://youtu.be/lxqHXG7AnBw).
