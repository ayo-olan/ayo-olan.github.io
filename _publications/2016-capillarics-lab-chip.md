This paper is about 3D-printing of self-powered and self-regulated microfluidic chips for automating liquid handling operations in a user-friendly and minimally-instrumented format. Prior to this work, the conventional view was that self-powered microfluidic chips, that move liquids using only capillary forces defined by geometry and surface chemistry and without any external valves and pumps, required the high precision (~ 10 μm) and sub-micron surface roughness provided by cleanroom fabrication. The reliance on cleanroom fabrication increased the time and cost required to develop new design iterations that advance the understanding of capillaric valves and circuits and employ them in clinically relevant applications. I conceived the idea to manufacture self-powered microchips by 3D-printing, designed and conducted experiments, and demonstrated that we could exceed the number of autonomous liquid handling steps previously achieved by cleanroom fabrication techniques.
