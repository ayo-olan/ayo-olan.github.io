This paper is about the application of capillaric circuits to a clinically relevant problem – rapid and user-friendly detection of bacteria in urine – by leveraging the capability to 3D-print large-volume (> 100 μL) devices and autonomous liquid handling offered by capillaric valves. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common bacterial infections and would benefit from a rapid point- of-care diagnostic test especially in vulnerable and non-verbal populations like infants. Although there are microfluidic systems for nucleic acid and whole bacteria immunoassay tests, their application is limited by complex protocols, bulky peripherals, and slow operation. We developed a capillaric circuit optimized for rapid and automated bacteria detection in urine. For efficient bacteria capture, on-the-spot packing of antibody-coated microbeads was completed in < 20s followed by autonomous sequential delivery of sample, detection antibodies, labeled fluorescent dye, and wash buffer. The assay was completed in < 7 min with all liquid handling steps automated by the credit-card sized capillaric circuit without any external pumps or valves. The assay had a limit of detection (103 cells/mL) that was well- below the clinical diagnostic criterion for UTI, making it suitable for potential use in rapid point-of-care UTI screening. We published in [Analytical Chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/ancham) (Impact factor 6.3), a leading journal in applied science and assay development and the paper has been cited 20 times so far (as of June 2020).
